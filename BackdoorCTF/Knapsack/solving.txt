I tried to find the key by finding a subset of the numbers in the sum that sum to k.

ECB cipher attacking https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unn09JYIjOI
- Encryption doesn't diffuse
- Same input --> same key
- There is a predictable output for each block we can list as a map

An attacker could
- Identify it two ECB messages are the same
- Identify if two ECM messages contain similar substrings if they are block aligned
- Identify repeated data in a message 
- Create "faked" ciphertexts due to independent encryption and decryption


We know the block size is 16 bytes for this cipher
==> due to this line ensuring our code's input size is mod 16
==> padded_flag = flag + b'\x00'*(-len(flag)%16)

'flag' is 4 bytes

Note: in ECB mode, the order of the blocks doesn't matter
As long as the padding in the final block is correct, the blocks can be decrypted in any order
